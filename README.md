If these have appeared you can start customizing the theme.

### General options

To start customizing the theme go to appearance -> General. There are the general options of the theme. There you can
add many things about your self to personalize the theme. The more things you add the better the theme will look. Most of the inputs
are optional though.

### Support options

Next up is the support menu which you access via appearance -> Support. Here you can activate the post formats you are going
to work with.

### Content options

Here are the options of customization for the actual theme. You can access this via appearance -> Content. Here you can choose
if you want the testimonials section to be there or not. Same with the blog section or the portfolio section. If you just want the
blog section to work in your theme , you can do that as well. The options are up to you. You can as well choose the background images that
you use in each section. Just upload some images that you can in your computer and you are ready to go!  
In this section you can choose as well the type of presentation you want for your portfolio and your header. You can change these
at the "Choose the front page template" and the "Choose the front portfolio template".

### Portfolio posts

To post your projects all you need to do is click on Portfolio and add new. The title will be the title of your project
and the content will be what you have to say about your project. To customize the content and make it look better you got some options

1. Use the bulleted list to make small headers inside the content.
2. Use the blockquote option to create blockquote inside the content.
3. Use the Bold option to emphasize on something.
4. Use the italic option to emphasize on something as well.

Things that have these options are automatically designed with css i used.

Now about the mataboxes that you will see below the content area.

The Header metabox is only useful for the default Template. The image will be used as a header, and the secondary text will be used
under the title inside the header image.

The Choose the details metabox is used to add information about the project. You can choose any information you want and add
up to 6 details. The first box is used to to say what the information is and  the information and the second box is used to give
the value of that information so:

If i input developer in the first box and My Name in the second post, the project will output:

developer : My Name.

Something else important is that any image posted inside the posts will be transfered on the bottom of the post.

The portfolio section got 3 different templates:

- Default Template (which we just talked about)
- Gallery
- Side image

The only difference with the side image and gallery template is that any image inside the content of the gallery will be transfered
and formated to create a gallery. The images inside the the side image template will be formated and transfered on the side of the content.

----**Featured Images are required to work properly**----

### Blog posts
