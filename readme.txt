Here are the instructions of how to customize the theme properly.

Lets go to one by one to show you how everything works first of all:

The theme steup is preety easy, to make everything work correct all you need
to do is:

Lets go to the settings of the portfolio now.
There should be a wrench with the title of "portfolio" on the menu. click on it.

on appearance > settings we got general things about you such us your name, adress , email and stuff like this.
The more info you insert the better your portfolio will look like in the end.

on appearance > support there are all the different format options of your blog. Enable them
for the best experience.

on appearance > content there are many options for you to change the actual content of your theme
like the pictures im using, your logo and some stuff about yourself.

The more info you put in these the better the theme will eventually look like. Lets move on to the portfolio
section. If you enabled the portfolio section in

appearance > content

then there should be an icon on  the menu with a man wearing a tie. Click on it. I have already 2 posts for you sitting
there so the main website would not look too empty on the beggining.You can delete those samples and you
can create here your own portfolio posts. add New.

There are 4 different styles of portfolios. The first one we will talk about is Default Template

Put as a title the job that you did and you can in the big space below the title everything that you did during the
job. Share the experience with the world. Now to make things more beatiful i have added support to make
your content if more colorfoul and beatiful. To highlight something you have written you can click on
blockquote sign on top of the content area. if you want to highlight your text but not too much
you can make it bold by using the bold making tool in top of the content area. It has a sign of a B.
Another way to highlight your text is to make it italic using the sign of a titled I. I you want to
create another title within your content area you can use the bulleted list tool.

Below the content area there is an area which says "header" This area is useful for when you have the
template of your page on "Default Template". The picture that is there will be in top of your page
and the text that writes secondary text will be below your title.

Below the header there is a text writing "Choose the details".
There you can add details about the project like which were the people taking part in the project or
whatever you want. There is a limitation to 6 details.

press on the more details button. On the left will be the name of the detail and in the right will be
the valueof the detail. Lets say you write Developer on the left and your name on the right.
the end result will be something like this

Developer : your name

If you add images in the content
then they will be formatted to fit perfectly in your portfolio post.

Lets move on to the second format of the portfolio posts: Gallery.

The gallery is exactly like the default Template. The only difference is that the Header section
does not play any role and that if you add images to the content section the images will be positioned
in your post and will slide.

Now about the side image template:

This is the same as well as the last 2 templates, with the difference that the images placed inside the content
area will be formatted differently. Try putting some images in the content area save it and take a look at it

The last template is the standard 1 column template:

In this template the images placed inside the content area will be inserted in the right side of the post.

**All the portfolio posts require a featured image which will be shown in the front page.**

The testimonial section is preety straight forward. You can add new testimonials by pressing
the add new button. Then insert the name of the person on the title, and what he thinks about you on
the content.

Lastly the blog.

The formatting of the content is the same as it was on the portfolio.

Now about the different formats.

To enable the formats go to portfolio > theme support  and click on all the boxes.

The standard format needs a featured image and just the content. Everything will be
put beatifully in order in the post.

The image format is for when you want to add several images inside your post. It shows them better.

The video format is for when you want to add a video in the post. max number:1.

The gallery format will once again put all your images that you inserted on your posts in the top
and slide through them.

Lastly, the widgets. I have created 2 widgets for you to show off your skills and your services.
Just drag and drop the widget in appearance > widgets to their content and you are ready to go.
